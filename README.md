## Task 1
Created a JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js` with a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

## Task 2
Added a function `formatArrayStrings` in `arrayManipulation.js` that takes two arrays (an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`) and modifies each string based on its corresponding number (capitalize if the number is even, convert to lowercase if the number is odd).

## Task 3
Created a file `userInfo.js` with a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2, and returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).

## Task 4
This is the README file with my student ID and a brief explanation of each task.
